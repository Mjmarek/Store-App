## Monigami Store App

**Description:** This is my first attempt at creating a truly customized site for Monigami, an origami store.  I have always wanted a place to showcase my handmade creations, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to make an attempt.  In the past, I have used drag-and-drop templated sites, such as Wix, but the final product was always a disappointment.  Once I learned HTML and CSS, I was able to create something that more closely matched my vision.  

**Extension:** Eventually, I would like to rework this page so that it is a full gallery website for Monigami.  Since this initial version was created so early on in my coding career, I am looking forward to remaking the site so that it is cleaner and more organized.  I would also like customers to be able to email me with custom orders directly from the wesbite.
